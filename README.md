Automated Faucet Coin Claiming for Blackhole Testnet on Avalanche

## Overview

BlackholeTestnet is a Python-based project designed to automate the claiming of testnet tokens for the Blackhole decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Avalanche Fuji testnet. Blackhole is an innovative AMM DEX featuring vote-escrow tokenomics, Genesis Pools, and community-driven liquidity bootstrapping.

This repository provides scripts to simplify acquiring testnet $BLACK tokens from the faucet, enabling developers and testers to participate in the Blackhole testnet ecosystem.
